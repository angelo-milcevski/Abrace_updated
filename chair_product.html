          <h1>THIS IS BIG CHAIR</h1>
          <p>One of their products is the chair that is built up in a special way.
            The foreclosure enables the chance to block out surrounding disturbance which creates a private space for the user.
            The blankets have special weight that gives a feeling of holding a baby. This provides grounding and has a calming effect on the body.
            The monotonous movement of foot-swing contributes to an activity based stimuli, which is good for relieving restlessness. Moreover, if the foot-swing is not being used it can be pulled back so it isn’t in the way.
            Note: You can buy the different pieces separately as well.
